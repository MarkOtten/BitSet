<h2>BitSet</h2>
 The BitSet class contains a pointer to a number of unsigned longs. The bits of the unsigned 
longs are used to represent the presence of (1) or absence of (0) a value. This class is useful when 
representing a series of boolean data types in a memory constrained environment, and differs from the standard
library bitSet class in that it can also perform the following set operations: union, intersection, difference
and ones complement.
